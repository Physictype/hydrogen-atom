        You probably have seen the Bohr model of the atom, and maybe you've seen the odd shapes of electron orbitals, such as the \(s\), \(p\), \(d\), and \(f\) orbitals. But where do these come from?
        It is a product of a century of mathematics and physics—Quantum Physics!
        <br/><br/>
        Of course, if we think about the number of electrons, one will be the least complex. By

            Coulomb's Law,

        the potential energy of the electron is
        $$V(r)=-K\frac{e^2}{r},$$
        where \(K\) is a constant, \(e\) is the charge of protons and electrons, and \(r\) is the distance between the proton and electron.
        We can essentially ignore the proton because it has so much more mass than the electron and will hardly move.
        <br/><br/>
        <div class="quiz" id="q1">
            <!--QUESTION: Why won't the proton move that much?-->
            <!--ANSWER !A: The proton will feel the same amount of force as the electron, but won't feel as much acceleration.-->
            <!--ANSWER B: The proton won't feel any force, and so will not move.-->
            <!--EXPLANATION: Due to the equation for force, \(F=ma\), the acceleration on the proton is much less than the acceleration on the electron. Therefore the answer is A.-->
        </div>
        <br/>
        Now, since this is only dependent on the distance between the two particles, we need to use
        <span class="term">
            Spherical Coordinates.
            <div class="defineterm">
                <strong>Spherical Coordinates</strong> is a coordinate system that, unlike the Cartesian coordinates most people know, use the distance to the origin and how the point is rotated from the center.
            </div>
        </span>
        If we use some complicated math to find simple equations for how

            Schrödinger's equation,
            <div class="defineterm">
                <strong>Schrödinger's equation</strong> is an equation in Quantum Physics that describes how particles evolve based on their potential energy function.
                It is written like so:
                $$i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi+V\psi.$$
                Here, \(\psi\) is the wave function, which describes where the particle is, based on probability.
                It looks very scary, but don't be scared—all this is describing, in more complicated terms, is that total energy
                is kinetic plus potential.

        <!-- <h2 id="hydrogen">The Hydrogen Atom</h2>
        <h3 id="hydrogen/motivation">Motivation</h3>
        The reason electron clouds exist is because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
        $$\sigma_x\sigma_p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}.$$
        The \(\sigma\) means standard deviation—think of it like the amount of "uncertainty." \(\sigma_x\) means the amount of uncertainty in the position, and \(\sigma_p\) means the uncertainty in momentum. This equation then means that if we know more about the position, we don't know much about the momentum, and vice versa. This is the way the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is normally stated.
        <br/><br/>
        Since we cannot know both position and momentum, we must use probabilities. An electron cloud is a 3d shape such that the electron has a certain probability of being inside it. The value we will use is 95%.
        <br/><br/>
        <h3 id="hydrogen/wavefunc">The wave function</h3>
        The simplest potential will be for a <b>neutral</b> Hydrogen Atom. To find the electron cloud, we must find probabilities of the electron being in a certain region. To do this, we must calculate the wave function.
        <br/><br/>
        Let us step back from the hydrogen atom and think about one dimension. The wave function, normally denoted \(\psi\), is a weird concept—it defines probability, yet the wave function itself <em>isn't the probability</em>. We must square the wave function. Since we are talking about continuous space, we must think about the integral of the wave function squared,
        $$\int_a^b|\psi(x)|^2\,dx.$$
        Now this has a lot packed into it. Think of the integral as taking the probability all over the region from the position being \(a\) to the position being \(b\). There is also the \(|\psi|^2\) term. You might be wondering, why are there absolute value signs around \(\psi\)? This is because the value of \(\psi\) is actually complex. It won't matter much, but that's why there are some \(i\)s and other stuff like that in the equations used in quantum physics. 
        -->
        <!-- The simplest potential will be for a <b>neutral</b> Hydrogen Atom. To find the potential energy, we can use Coulomb's law: -->
        <!-- $$F=K\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}.$$
        While this is not yet a potential energy function but a force, we can find the potential energy by taking the negative of its integral, which gives
        $$\begin{align*}
            V(r)&=-K\int\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\,dr\\
            &=-K\left(-\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\right)\\
            &=K\frac{q_1q_2}{r}.
        \end{align*}$$
        Now, we plug this into the Schrödinger Equation, which gives
        $$\begin{align*}
            i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}&=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\left[\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta} \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial \phi^{2}}\right]+V\psi\\
            &=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\left[\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta} \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial \phi^{2}}\right]+K\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\psi.
        \end{align*}$$
        While this is very scary, it is solvable.

            <!--ANSWER A: The potential is dependent on \(q_1\) and \(q_2\).-->
            <!--ANSWER !B: The potential is dependent on \(r\), not \(\theta\) or \(\phi\).-->
            <!--EXPLANATION: The potential is dependent on three variables: \(q_1\), \(q_2\), and \(r\). In a hydrogen atom, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are constants—they don't change (under normal conditions). Therefore, the only thing that changes is \(r\), and this means that the potential is symmetric with respect to rotation. Then, since the potential energy function is symmetric, the probabiity will be too. Thus the answer is B.-->
