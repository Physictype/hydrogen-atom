            in progress...
            You probably have seen the Bohr model of the atom, and maybe you've seen the odd shapes of electron orbitals, such as the \(s\), \(p\), \(d\), and \(f\) orbitals. But where do these come from?
            It is a product of a century of mathematics and physics—Quantum Physics!
            <br/><br/>
            Of course, if we think about the number of electrons, one will be the least complex. By

            the potential energy of the electron is
            $$V(r)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{r},$$
            where \(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\) is a constant, \(e\) is the charge of protons and electrons, and \(r\) is the distance between the proton and electron.
            We can essentially ignore the proton because it has so much more mass than the electron and will hardly move.
            <br/><br/>

                <!--EXPLANATION: Due to the equation for force, \(F=ma\), the acceleration on the proton is much less than the acceleration on the electron. Therefore the answer is A.-->

                Schrödinger's equation
                <div class="defineterm">
                    <strong>Schrödinger's equation</strong> is an equation in Quantum Physics that describes how particles evolve based on their potential energy function.
                    It is written like so:
                    $$i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi+V\psi.$$
                    Here, \(\psi\) is the wave function.
                    It looks very scary, but don't be scared—all this is describing, in more complicated terms, is that total energy
                    is kinetic plus potential.
                </div>
            </span>
            into three much more managable equations. This works because the potential energy function only depends on the distance to the nucleus, \(r\).
            <br/>
            In doing so, we get the orbitals of the hydrogen atom.
            <br/>
            Not just these, either. The math predicts other orbitals, not just \(s\), \(p\), \(d\), \(f\)—there's \(g\), \(h\), \(i\), no \(j\), of course, then \(k\), et cetra.
            <br/>
            For example, here's an \(i\) orbital, rendered using <a href="https://github.com/Physictype/electron-orbital-visualiser">a python program I made.</a>
            <img src="i_orbital.png"/>
            <br/>
            The orbitals higher in energy than \(f\) orbitals generally have too much energy to appear in a real atom—however \(g\) and \(h\) are possible in excited states of atoms.
            <h2>Step 1: Seperate</h2>
            There's a lot of math in these sections, but bear with me. The steps to make the equation look better aren't as bad as they look. If we write \(\psi=R(r)Y(\theta,\phi)\), we can write the Schrödinger equation to get
            $$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left[\frac{Y}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+\frac{R}{r^2\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{R}{r^2\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial\phi^2}\right]+VRY=ERY,$$
            where \(V\) is the potential, which as we have discussed, is only dependent on \(r\), and \(E\) is just the energy of the electron.
            The beauty of this is that it can be seperated into a sum of expressions, one dependent on \(\theta\) and \(\phi\), and one dependent on \(r\)!
            To do this, first let us divide by \(YR\). This gives us
            $$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left[\frac{1}{Rr^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+\frac{1}{Yr^2\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{Yr^2\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial\phi^2}\right]+V=E.$$
            Now, if we divide by \(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\) (or multiply by \(-\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\)), we can take out that constant at the front:
            $$\frac{1}{Rr^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+\frac{1}{Yr^2\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{Yr^2\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial\phi^2}=-\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\left(E-V\right),$$
            and notice how many terms have \(r^2\) in the bottom. Multiplying by \(r^2\) will make this simpler, and it gives
            $$\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)+\frac{1}{Y\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{Y\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial\phi^2}=-\frac{2mr^2}{\hbar^2}\left(E-V\right).$$
            So if we rearrange this, we get
            $$\left\{\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)-\frac{2mr^2}{\hbar^2}\left(V-E\right)\right\}+\left\{\frac{1}{Y\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{Y\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial\phi^2}\right\}=0,$$
            and finally,
            $$\left\{\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)-\frac{2mr^2}{\hbar^2}\left(V-E\right)\right\}+\frac{1}{Y}\left\{\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial\phi^2}\right\}=0.$$
            We have one expression dependent only on \(r\), and one expression dependent on \(\theta\) and \(\phi\).
            This means we can set one to some constant, and the other one will be the negative of that constant. For reasons we will not see due to their appearance in the end solving of these differential equations, this constant will be called \(\ell(\ell+1)\).
            So we have
            $$\frac{1}{R}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dR}{dr}\right)-\frac{2mr^2}{\hbar^2}\left(V-E\right)=\ell(\ell+1)$$
            and
            $$\frac{1}{Y}\left\{\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial\phi^2}\right\}=-\ell(\ell+1).$$
            Now, we have to seperate \(Y\). To do this, let us first cancel out the \(Y\sin^2\theta\) term found all over this equation.
            This gives 
            $$\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{\partial^2Y}{\partial\phi^2}=-\ell(\ell+1)Y\sin^2\theta.$$
            Now, we seperate \(Y\) into a function of \(\theta\) and a function of \(\phi\), i.e. \(Y(\theta,\phi)=\Theta(\theta)\Phi(\phi)\).
            This gives
            $$\Phi\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial\theta}\right)+\Theta\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial\phi^2}=-\ell(\ell+1)\Theta\Phi\sin^2\theta.$$
            Now, we divide by \(\Theta\Phi\) to get
            $$\frac{1}{\Theta}\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial\phi^2}=-\ell(\ell+1)\sin^2\theta,$$
            so, if we rearrange,
            $$\left\{\frac{1}{\Theta}\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial\theta}\right)+\ell(\ell+1)\sin^2\theta\right\}+\frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial\phi^2}=0.$$
            This time, we set
            $$\frac{1}{\Theta}\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial\theta}\right)+\ell(\ell+1)\sin^2\theta=m^2,$$
            so
            $$\frac{1}{\Phi}\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial\phi^2}=-m^2.$$
            If we look at the second equation, we have
            $$\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial\phi^2}=-m^2\Phi.$$
            <h2>Step 2: Solving the equations</h2>
            The solutions to this differential equation are
            $$\Phi(\phi)=e^{im\phi}.$$
            Now, since if we go around a full circle in spherical coordinates, i.e, if we add \(2\pi\) (
                <div class="term">
                    radians
                    <div class="defineterm">
                        <strong>Radians</strong> are just a measure of angle, where \(360^circ\) is \(2\pi\) radians, or the circumference of a unit circle. 
                    </div>
                </div>
            ) to \(\phi,\) the wave function should be the same.
            Therefore
            $$e^{im\phi}=e^{im(\phi+2\pi)}.$$
            If you haven't seen how \(e^{i\theta}\) works, this will be a little hand-wavy, but this implies \(m\) is an integer.
            <br/>
            The equation for \(\Theta\) is a little bit complicated. However, it does give us some useful information. It tells us \(\ell\) is a positive integer, and \(-\ell\le m\le\ell\).
            <br/>
            The other equation we can actually simplify is the one on \(r\). If we set \(u(r)=rR(r)\), we end up with
            $$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}+\left[V+\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}\right]u=Eu.$$
            Now, this is actually similar to the Schrödinger equation—except \(V\) has been replaced by \(V+\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}\). That extra term acts like the centrifugal force in classical physics, which makes sense as the electron is "orbiting" the nucleus!
            If we divide by \(E\), we get
            $$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2mE}\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}+\left[\frac{V}{E}+\frac{\hbar^2}{2mE}\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}\right]u=u.$$
            We can set \(\kappa=\frac{\sqrt{-2mE}}{\hbar}\) to get
            $$\frac{1}{\kappa^2}\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}+\left[\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\frac{V}{\kappa^2}-\frac{1}{\kappa^2}\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}\right]u=u.$$
            Now, if we rearrange this, it becomes a little bit nicer:
            $$\frac{1}{\kappa^2}\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}=\left[1-\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\frac{V}{\kappa^2}+\frac{1}{\kappa^2}\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}\right]u.$$
            Substituting our potential, we get
            $$\frac{1}{\kappa^2}\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}=\left[1-\frac{me^2}{2\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2\kappa}\frac{1}{\kappa r}+\frac{1}{\kappa^2}\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}\right]u.$$
            What we can do now is set \(\rho=\kappa r\) and \(\rho_0=\frac{me^2}{2\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2\kappa}\). This gives
            $$\frac{d^2u}{d\rho^2}=\left[1-\rho_0\frac{1}{\rho}+\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{\rho^2}\right]u.$$
            Here we look at what happens when \(\rho\to0\) and when \(\rho\to\infty\).
            When \(\rho\to\infty\), \(1\) is largest, so we essentially have
            $$\frac{d^2u}{d\rho^2}u\approx u,$$
            which gives
            $$u\approx Ae^{-\rho}+Be^{\rho}.$$
            However, \(Be^{\rho}\) goes to infinity as \(\rho\) goes to infinity, so we cannot have that term (for normalization reasons). The solution is then
            $$u\approx Ae^{-\rho}$$
            When \(\rho\to0\), the \(\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{\rho^2}\) term dominates, so
            $$\frac{d^2u}{d\rho^2}=\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{\rho^2}u.$$
            The general solution of this equation is actually
            $$u\approx C\rho^{\ell+1}+D\rho^{-\ell},$$
            but \(D\rho^{-\ell}\) will go to infinity as \(\rho\) goes to zero, and we don't want that to happen, so the solution is
            $$u\approx C\rho^{\ell+1}.$$
            Now, we set

        <!-- <h2 id="hydrogen">The Hydrogen Atom</h2>
        <h3 id="hydrogen/motivation">Motivation</h3>
        The reason electron clouds exist is because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
        $$\sigma_x\sigma_p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}.$$
        The \(\sigma\) means standard deviation—think of it like the amount of "uncertainty." \(\sigma_x\) means the amount of uncertainty in the position, and \(\sigma_p\) means the uncertainty in momentum. This equation then means that if we know more about the position, we don't know much about the momentum, and vice versa. This is the way the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is normally stated.
        <br/><br/>
        Since we cannot know both position and momentum, we must use probabilities. An electron cloud is a 3d shape such that the electron has a certain probability of being inside it. The value we will use is 95%.
        <br/><br/>
        <h3 id="hydrogen/wavefunc">The wave function</h3>
        The simplest potential will be for a <b>neutral</b> Hydrogen Atom. To find the electron cloud, we must find probabilities of the electron being in a certain region. To do this, we must calculate the wave function.
        <br/><br/>
        Let us step back from the hydrogen atom and think about one dimension. The wave function, normally denoted \(\psi\), is a weird concept—it defines probability, yet the wave function itself <em>isn't the probability</em>. We must square the wave function. Since we are talking about continuous space, we must think about the integral of the wave function squared,
        $$\int_a^b|\psi(x)|^2\,dx.$$
        Now this has a lot packed into it. Think of the integral as taking the probability all over the region from the position being \(a\) to the position being \(b\). There is also the \(|\psi|^2\) term. You might be wondering, why are there absolute value signs around \(\psi\)? This is because the value of \(\psi\) is actually complex. It won't matter much, but that's why there are some \(i\)s and other stuff like that in the equations used in quantum physics. 
        -->
        <!-- The simplest potential will be for a <b>neutral</b> Hydrogen Atom. To find the potential energy, we can use Coulomb's law: -->
        <!-- $$F=K\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}.$$
        While this is not yet a potential energy function but a force, we can find the potential energy by taking the negative of its integral, which gives
        $$\begin{align*}
            V(r)&=-K\int\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\,dr\\
            &=-K\left(-\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\right)\\
            &=K\frac{q_1q_2}{r}.
        \end{align*}$$
        Now, we plug this into the Schrödinger Equation, which gives
        $$\begin{align*}
            i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}&=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\left[\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta} \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial \phi^{2}}\right]+V\psi\\
            &=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\left[\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^{2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right)+\frac{1}{r^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta} \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial \phi^{2}}\right]+K\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\psi.
        \end{align*}$$
        While this is very scary, it is solvable.
